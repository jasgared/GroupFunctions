This repo is to explore the Azure Function Apps' in C#. Consists of exploration of calling two functions in a function app.

1. The first Function1.cs is a HTTP trigger function that takes in name and prints a string message.
2. The second Function2.cs is also a HTTP trigger function which will try to trigger Function1.cs from inside it.
